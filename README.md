# Recommendation-System-For-Big-Data
This system is developed for recommending most similar products based on the search history of the user and the currentselected product. 
We implement two algorithms, and then test them on some existing datasets to do comparisons and generate results. 
They can be used to predict the rating for a product that a customer has never reviewed, based on the data of all other users and their ratings in the system. 
This project is useful in finding the most similar products against a selected product from previous history of user using sentiment analysis and cosine similarity function. 
This results in meaningful recommendations of products. this system can be applicable in
major recommendations sites like AMAZON, NETFLIX, PANDORA etc. to provide better recommendations.
